FOSS Alternatives
=================
FOSS stands for free, open-source software. Free means the software comes at no cost to the user and some more--see the conditions to meet the `definition of free`_ by the Free Software Foundation. Open-source means the instructions for the program are made readily available in a way that enables one to see how the program works and to modify it--see the full conditions to meet the `definition of open`_ provided by the Open Source Initiative.

A list of FOSS alternatives to commonly used commercial software in chemical engineering is below:
